net: atl1e: fix soft lockup on out-of-range hw_next_to_clean read

Same issue as atl1c (see the first commit in this series, "net:
atl1c: fix soft lockup on out-of-range tpd_cons read"): the hardware
can report an out-of-range hw_next_to_clean (seen as 0xffff) while
the PCIe link/MAC is resetting. An out-of-range value can never be
reached and the loop below would spin forever. Treat it as "nothing
new to clean" instead.
