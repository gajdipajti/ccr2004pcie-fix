net: atl1c: fix soft lockup on out-of-range tpd_cons read

The hardware can report an out-of-range tpd_cons (seen as 0xffff)
while the PCIe link/MAC is resetting. An out-of-range value can
never be reached and the loop below would spin forever. To avoid
a soft lockup treat it as "nothing new to clean" instead.

Reproduced on two machines, same NIC (Qualcomm Atheros AR8151 v2.0,
4-port), triggered by rebooting a Mikrotik CCR2004 PCIe card that
the ports are directly linked to:

- Ubuntu 26.04.1 LTS, kernel 7.0.0-31-generic. The link-flap
  precursor, before the lockup was captured with a full trace
  elsewhere:

    atl1c 0000:05:00.0 enp5s0f0: NETDEV WATCHDOG: CPU: 4: transmit queue 2 timed out 489984 ms
    atl1c 0000:05:00.0: MAC state machine can't be idle since disabled for 10ms second
    atl1c 0000:05:00.0: atl1c: enp5s0f0 NIC Link is Up<65535 Mbps Full Duplex>

  65535 (0xffff) here is the same value tpd_cons reads back once the
  loop below gets stuck.

- Proxmox VE, kernel 7.0.14-11-pve. Same NIC/trigger, this time
  caught by the soft lockup watchdog with a full stack trace:
